# Hairdresser Simulation
 Code for a makeshift hairdresser simulation that was outlined in one of my maths lectures

 The process goes as follows:
 Customer enters store
 Waits for a hairdresser to become available 
 Determines whether they want a haircut (10 minutes) or haircut and shampoo (20 minutes)
 Has the job performed and leaves
